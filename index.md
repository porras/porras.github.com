# [Sergio Gil](/)
## I am a web developer. I live in Berlin.

I am also known around the web as *porras*.

I do web development for a life. I mainly use [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for that, and I have around six years of experience with them.

I like to [contribute](http://ghcontributors.herokuapp.com/porras) to Open Source software. Among those contributions, those on [Rails](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/sergio-gil/commits) are the ones I'm most proud of.

I like to participate in the community. While I was living in Madrid, I helped create the [local user group](http://madridrb.jottit.com/) and organize a couple of editions of [Conferencia Rails](http://conferenciarails.org/). I have also [spoken](/talks) a few times at those and other events.
