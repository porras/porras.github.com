# A [git] workflow
## [madrid-rb](https://madridrb.jottit.com/) January 2011

I gave this talk (in Spanish) in the [Madrid Ruby User Group](https://madridrb.jottit.com/) monthly meeting. It's a high level description of the workflow we used during years at [BeBanjo](http://bebanjo.com/). Half methodology (it describes a [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development) workflow), half technology (it shows how to implement that workflow using [git](http://git-scm.com/)). These were the slides I used:
