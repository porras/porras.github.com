*I also wrote a long article based on this talk, find it [here](/writings/2013/five-languages-in-a-moment/)*.

I had a lot of fun preparing this talk. It was a *whole* lot of work but it was worth it. Lately I had been interested in *non-mainstream* (which, in my not very academical world means anything that's not like Ruby, Perl, Python, PHP, Javascript, C or Java) languages, and I wanted to share my findings and conclusions with my fellow rubyists.

This was the description in the conference webpage:

> > “A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.” — Alan Perlis

> Fortunately, there are plenty of them.

> Once upon a time, Ruby blew our minds. That simple, nice, funny, almost naive Japanese little language didn’t only “affect the way we thought about programming” but in the process changed our jobs, our industry, and in some cases almost our lives. Could it be that it is the only language that could have done it, or even do it in the future? That could be the case, but that kind of simplistic and comfortable truths aren’t for rubyists. As it turns out there are a lot of things out there capable of blowing your mind once again.

> This humble developer has made a crash course into five of them, not to find The Next Big Thing™, but to find the next simple, nice, funny, and why not naive thing, and is ready to share his conclusions, and challenge his summarizing abilities and tell you something useful about all five of them in 35 minutes. And of course having a good and fun time in the process. May the Source be with him.
