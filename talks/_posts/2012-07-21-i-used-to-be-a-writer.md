I gave this short talk in a very nice conference in Poznan, Poland, which consisted on a whole day of short talks.

It was a kind of inspirational talk exploring the similarity between human languages and programming languages, how I think that what makes a good programmer is the same kind of thing that makes a good writer, and the importance of the tone of a language, human or not.

Funnily enough, the same weekend, and without having talked about it, my friend Enrique wrote [this nice article](http://kikito.github.com/blog/2012/07/19/coding-with-an-accent/) about mostly the same topic. Great minds think alike ;)
