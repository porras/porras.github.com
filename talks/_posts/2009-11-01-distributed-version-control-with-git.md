title: Distributed Version Control with GIT

I gave this talk (in Spanish) in the [Linux User Group](http://gul.es/) yearly conferences days. It was an introduction (although it covers fairly advanced uses, it was a long talk, almost a course) to version control with Git.

Since then, I have done slightly modified versions of this talk as private courses in companies.

These were the slides I used. The first slide using <span style='font-family: "Comic Sans MS"'>Comic Sans</span> is a joke ;)
